I have come today not primarily to defend a man, but, to defend, with all my power, those things which have made Athens enormously successful, admirable, coveted, and feared by peoples everywhere, and to defend the key component of our culture—which is altogether ignored in Argos, Miletus, Persia and Sparta—: its attention to the individual.  We Athenians have always admired individuals who champion our culture and praise those who, through their talents, are inspirations to us all.  Take Solon.  A poet and revered sage who used his wisdom for the betterment of Greece, serves as an inspiration to us all.  Homer, Hesiod, Ajax, and wily Odysseus, each being front-runners in their trades, are our heroes because of their accomplishments in their fields.  And it is for this reason that the names of individuals who, with bravery and boldness, founded cities with pious laws and customs, were ascribed to the 10 tribes.  For the same reason, we admire those who challenge authority when authority tries to strip individuals’ worth.  We share pride in the repulsion of Isagoras and the oligarchical Spartans and in beating back the Persians at Marathon and Salamis, and, whether or not Harmodius and Aristogeiton actually killed a tyrant, we like to believe that they did.  

These individuals and demonstrations of self-reliance have always served as sources of motivation and show us the caliber of acts and of men needed to win Athens its renown.  We must not lose our reverence for these acts and these men.  We must embrace the spirit which made our fathers admirable and our city so strong.  Look at the Spartans, they do not admire the individual.  They do not put faith in the individual.  And so, they do not have or deserve representation.  Our Athenian fathers, who chose to believe in us, fought against this mindset in order to establish the government of representation which has brought us lasting peace for 100 years (dating this back to Hippias’ rule, which in 510 ended because of the Alcmaeonids’ siege).  And so our democracy, which champions the individual, must be maintained and we must never lose sight of the fact that it was built to protect the citizens—You!  In light of this, I hope you may consider how Phormio’s actions were in concurrence with the statutes exemplified by our fathers, and, that you may understand that Phormio, in battle, was forced to oblige certain scruples to which we are all indebted. 

 In battle, each leader has 2 obligations.  First and foremost: to win.  Secondly, yet equally important, as regards the health of his military and therefore the continuing protection of his city, is that he protect his soldiers.  Phormio, when ordered by General Diodes to retreat, although hesitant to do so, was all the more reticent to lead his soldiers back to the ships after having gotten word, or should I say, after having been informed, that the majority of platoons had been captured on their way back to the ships—suggesting that the Sicilians or their allies had enclosed the army.  Knowing this, and being made very weary by the fact that his general, being so well-informed, was continuing to issue commands of retreat, Phormio could not help but fear that his men would also be captured in retreat, particularly because the Sicilians seemingly had them enclosed and his general, like another general of recent, was exhibiting behavior expressive of treasonous motivation.  Therefore, Phormio decided to order his men to remain on the battlefield until General Diodes himself retreated, at the occurrence of which, Phormio planned to follow the general’s path of retreat, so as to secure the best chance of survival for his men in the event that General Diodes was in fact a man of treason.  However, Phormio did not need to act upon this plan because the battle ended with the onset of night.  Nevertheless, as a result of Phormio’s orders, his men did not get captured in retreat and only a small portion of his men died after the issuance of his command.  

With Phormio’s knowledge of the situation, “could you have taken such an order with the lives of your many soldiers at stake?”  Having recently witnessed the treasonous acts of Alcibiades, Peisander, and Pausanius, I argue that it was not only reasonable, but obligatory to refuse the general’s orders, and that it would have been and remains any officer’s duty to question suspicious commands and to adopt an attitude of suspicion toward anyone exhibiting treasonous behavior in battle. 

Now that you can see how the actions of General Diodes depict him as a man with a severe lack of concern for his soldiers, as a man with an almost inconceivable incompetence in the field of battle, or as a traitor, I hope that you may see through the eyes of Phormio on the shore of Sicily, as he courageously refused to direct his men away from the battlefield but stood his ground in defiance.

I want to stress that I make this claim not for the life of an individual man, but for the preservation of prosperity of this country and out of an obligation to honor the exemplary daringness which is rooted in the spirit that brought this city greatness. However, it is through men like Phormio that we can witness the spirit of our forefathers and only in men of his caliber whom we can entrust the continuing prosperity of our country.  I hope that, in considering whether Phormio’s actions are lawful or unlawful, you may ask yourselves what you may have done in Phormio’s position being in charge of hundreds of men.  May the gods remain with us in our decision and with this city in this war.
Thank you.
