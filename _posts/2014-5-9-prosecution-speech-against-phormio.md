It is a must that an army be organized in a pyramid-like structure, where the general is at the top giving orders and the soldiers are beneath, taking them.  This is so because one cannot afford to waste time in battle.  Expediency is crucial.  If things change in the midst of battle and adjustments need to be made, we need to make decisions quickly.  In order to do so, it is necessary to have one person making these decisions.  This system has been proven trustworthy by our ancestors, by us (in recent encounters with the Spartans and their allies), and by civilizations throughout the world.  For this reason, we put faith in this system.  And we have further reason to place hope in this system because we live in a democracy, where a large portion of our citizens can feel assured that the general elected is credible.  In fact, this system works so well that we also have this structure in politics, where the archons are the head decision-makers and the other office-holders have less power.  Provided that we have good leaders—for which purpose we instituted democracy—this system works well.  

(Pause) 

However, if, blinded by selfishness or aroused by personal gain, we begin to disobey the laws and orders of the leaders whom our fellow citizens have elected into office, we risk falling into anarchy.  In a state of anarchy, a city’s state of affairs deteriorates and progress cannot be made because no one is in charge.  Now, imagine that a state of anarchy erupted in the army’s ranks in the midst of battle.  With the general’s commands carrying no weight, it would be very difficult for a group of thousands of men to achieve victory over an enemy.  Now, I do not assert that Phormio is an anarchist by any means.  To say so would be an overstatement.  However, I do allege that, in our recent engagement with the Sicilians, Phormio severely endangered the army by exhibiting behavior conducive of anarchic chaos.  

As you already know, this battle ended without success.  General Diodes, having been recently re-elected by a vast majority largely because of his recent display of valor at the Battle of Melos, was the general of this battle.  Being experienced, he noticed the unfortunate unfolding of events and—in order to minimalize losses—ordered leaders of platoons, in small groups, to retreat back to the ships.  Yet when Phormio, himself leader of a platoon, received the general’s orders, he refused.  Instead, he commanded his men to continue fighting, supposedly “for the good of the country.”  Nevertheless, Phormio is no martyr.  By disobeying the general, he belittled the security of your sons and disrespected you by disobeying the man democracy voted into office.  He did not save any men in his act of disobedience, but rather incited further slaughter in a battle we had lost.  

(Pause)

We cannot afford acts of self-righteousness like this.  They do not belong in battle.  We cannot afford to indulge a single platoon leader’s stubbornness.   Time is too precious and the UNITY of the army must stay intact.  

Think of the army like a body.  In a body, if the arms and legs fall asleep or begin to move without the consent of the head, it is very difficult for a plan to be achieved and time is wasted regaining control of the independent limb.  Likewise, if one part of an army unit dissents from the rest without consent of the general, the mission of the army at hand is complicated because the general is forced to attend to the dissention of the unit.  In doing so, time is wasted and the lives of other men in the army are put at stake.  Therefore, in disobeying his commander, Phormio not only disrespected the wishes of the democracy and neglected the protection of his own soldiers, but also put the lives of many additional soldiers at risk.  

There is also something to be said about the severity of Phormio’s dissent in light of the fact that a general has access to much more knowledge of an army’s overall state of affairs in a battle than a platoon leader.  The general, unlike the soldiers or platoon leaders, are informed by special informants.  A platoon leader rarely, if ever has informants coming to inform him.  Yet Phormio, even in his severe ignorance of the situation at large, still had the gall to disobey his commander and to put the lives of his men at stake. 

In short, Phormio jeopardized the lives of his own men and of others, lacked respect for the commands of men greater than him and for the lives of those under his command, and set aside the desires of the democracy for his own.    

  Ladies and gentlemen, I am allowing you an opportunity to expel someone who is a further hindrance in our desperate situation.  If your son or kinsman is out there, in a losing battle, would you take joy in knowing that they are being directed by a man who does not follow the orders of his general’s battle strategy, but in pride, follows his own?  A man who, when ordered to save your son in the face of impending death, refuses to do so because of his own stubbornness?  With commanders like this, are you willing to put faith in the future of this country? 

 We are in a desperate situation.  Money is in shortage and we are pinched for resources.  I hope we can win this war and win it quickly.  I cannot, however, maintain hope knowing that our army is plagued by leaders with a severe deficiency of character.  Phormio’s actions must not be tolerated, especially while traitors such as Alcibiades are at large.  We must maintain unity.  And, in doing so, we must stubbornly fight to keep intact the democracy for which our fathers fought and for which our country stands. 
 Thank you and may the gods be with you in your jurisdiction.
