I am a senior at USC studying classical literature and philosophy.  I take pleasure in getting to know people, their stories, and their life experiences.  For this reason, I love interactive public speaking!

At USC, I created a public speaking group on campus called "Syrius Speakers." As a result of founding this group, I was able to deliver a speech in USC’s very own “Bovard” Auditorium in October, 2016.  Titled “Make America New Again,” the speech was designed to encourage us all to redirect our energies from being concerned with what others think to engaging in things which progressively contribute to our personal development.  Drawing on my college experiences, I illustrate the benefits of putting our faith in individuals and hope to encourage others to let their voices be heard regardless of their political leanings. 

My goal is to help people find inspiration in public speaking and from themselves.
